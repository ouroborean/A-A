# Balance History


## Balance Change 0.9.943 (4/28/2022)

Changes for adjustment to base 200 health pool and minor balance pass

## Character Changes

### La Pucelle
* **Ideal Strike**: Health threshold adjusted to 75 from 50.

### Cranberry
Cranberry has been struggling to execute Merciless Finish and doesn't have much of an effect with Illusory Disorientation, given how relatively easy it is to break out of it and its long cooldown. While we don't believe it should return to being an AOE ability, we're lowering its cost and cooldown to make it more of a bread-and-butter option for the Musician of the Forest.
* **Illusory Disorientation**: Cost reduced by 1 Random, to 1 Special. Cooldown reduced to 1. Duration reduced to 1.

### Nemurin
Nemurin is working way too well in situations that suit her, and way too badly in situations that don't. We're trying to bring that strength back towards the middle.
* **Nemurin Nap**: No longer heals Nemurin while active. Nemurin will not gain sleep depth following turns during which she used an ability, but will no longer lose sleep depth from continuous damage.

### Snow White
Adjusting the cooldown of Hear Distress to give Snow White's opponents some room to breath.
* **Hear Distress**: Cooldown increased by 1, to 2.

### Seryu
* **Body Modification - Self Destruct**: Health threshold adjusted to 50 from 30.
* **Insatiable Justice**: Health threshold adjusted to 50 from 30.

### Mine
* **Roman Artillery - Pumpkin**: Health thresholds adjusted to 120 and 60 from 60 and 30.
* **Cutdown Shot**: Health thresholds adjusted to 100 and 50 from 50 and 25.

### Chrome
* **You Are Needed**: Mukuro-switching health threshold adjusted to 80 from 30.

### Akame
In order for Akame's instant-killing potential to still feel threatening, One Cut Killing will now deal half the damaged target's health over two turns, giving them time to heal, act, or achieve immunity.
* **One Cut Killing**: Damage adjusted to 100 affliction damage *for two turns*.

### Tatsumi
Similarly to Akame, Tatsumi's Neuntote combo was designed with 100 health in mind, so we're amping the base damage so that its multiplier still feels significant.
* **Neuntote**: Base damage adjusted to 25.

### Ryohei
Ryohei's ramp-up with To The Extreme! wasn't worth using outside of Vongola Headgear, which lead to situations where he never acted outside of it. To combat this, we're making Vongola Headgear a little harder and a little less worth it to use.
* **Vongola Headgear**: Duration decreased by one turn, to two turns. Cost increased by 1 Random, to 2 Random.
* **To The Extreme!**: Ryohei now gains stacks every 30 points of damage he receives, up from 20.

### Naruha
In preparation for the adjustments to base damage increases, Naruha's rabbit suit is being given a bit more thicc-ness.
* **Perfect Paper - Rampage Suit**: Destructible defense increased to 100, from 70.

### Frenda
While Doll Trap is working as intended, Frenda struggles to get significant value out of Close Combat Bombs due to its short duration. We're removing that duration to give her room to trap the board.
* **Close Combat Bombs**: Duration removed.

### Shokuhou
* **Exterior**: Affliction damage increased to 40, from 25.

### Gunha
With twice as much health to chop through, Gunha is going to need a lot more Guts to make it through. We're helping out his recharge rate just a touch.
* **Guts**: Heal increased to 35, from 25. Guts stacks gained from re-use increased to 3, from 2.

### Toga
At her current rates, Toga is having a hard time justifying the cost of her abilities. We're increasing the stacks she gets from both her abilities in order to help her hop into and out of forms quickly.
* **Thirsting Knife**: Now grants two stacks of Quirk - Transform, up from one.
* **Vacuum Syringe**: Duration increased to 3, from 2.

### Midoriya
Midoriya no longer needs a self-stun on SMASH!. We'll keep an eye on him as damage is adjusted.
* **SMASH!**: No longer stuns Midoriya on use.

### Itachi
* **Susano'o**: Removal health threshold adjusted to 50, from 25.

### Minato
It was brought to my attention that 35 piercing damage that ignores invulnerability was a little much for a single energy, even with a two turn cooldown. We're toning Minato down a bit.
* **Flying Raijin**: Damage reduced to 25, from 35. Cooldown reduced to 1, from 2.
